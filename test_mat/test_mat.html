      <b>test_mat</b>,
      a Python code which 
      defines test matrices for which the condition number, determinant,
      eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inverse, null vectors, P*L*U factorization
      or linear system solution are known.  Examples include the 
      Fibonacci, Hilbert, Redheffer, Vandermonde, Wathen and Wilkinson 
      matrices.
    </p>

    <p> 
      A wide range of matrix 
      dimensions, forms and properties are available.  These matrices may be 
      useful in testing an algorithm for correctness on a variety of problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of the matrices can be rectangular, with the user specifying
      the number of rows and columns.  Almost all the matrices can be
      made of arbitrary size, with the user specifying the dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many different matrix zero structures are available, including diagonal,
      bidiagonal, tridiagonal, pentadiagonal, banded, upper and lower
      triangular, and Hessenberg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many different matrix symmetry patterns are available, including
      symmetric, antisymmetric, persymmetric, circulant, Toeplitz, and
      Hankel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of the matrices come from a MATLAB M file collection developed by 
      Nicholas Higham, Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester.
    </p>

    <p>
      An earlier version of the collection is available, again as MATLAB 
      M files, in ACM TOMS Algorithm 694, in the TOMS directory of
      <a href = "https://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of these matrices, and many other matrices, are available at
      <a href = "https://math.nist.gov/">
                 https://math.nist.gov</a>,
      the Matrix Market web site.

ellipse_grid_count_test:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ellipse_grid_count can count the points in a grid,
  with N+1 points on the minor half axis,
  based on any ellipse.

  We use N = 8
  Radius R = (2,1)
  Center C = (1,2)

  Number of grid points will be 455

ellipse_grid_points_test:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ellipse_grid_points can define a grid of points
  with N+1 points on the minor half axis,
  based on any ellipse.

  We use N = 8
  Radius R = (2,1)
  Center C = (1,2)

  Number of grid points will be 455

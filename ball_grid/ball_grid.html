    <p>
      <b>ball_grid</b>,
      a Python code which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of an arbitrary ball in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code allows the user to define an arbitrary ball by
      choosing its radius and center.  The user also choose N, the number
      of subintervals into which a horizontal radius line will be subdivided.
      It then returns the gridpoints defined by that choice.

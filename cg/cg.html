      <b>cg</b>,
      a Python code which
      implements a simple version of the conjugate gradient (CG) method
      for solving a system of linear equations of the form A*x=b, 
      suitable for situations in which the matrix A is positive definite
      (only real, positive eigenvalues) and symmetric.

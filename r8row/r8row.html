      <b>r8row</b>,
      a Python code which
      contains utility routines for R8ROW's, that is,
      double precision real MxN arrays, considered as M row vectors,
      each of length N.  The data may be thought of as a matrix of
      multiple rows, and many operations will be carried out rowwise.

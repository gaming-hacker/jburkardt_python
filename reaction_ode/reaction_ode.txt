reaction_ode_test():
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Solve the reaction ODE.

  Reaction differential equation:
    da/dt = - k a b
    db/dt = - k a b
    dc/dt = + k a b

  Parameter values:
    k     =  0.02 , (reaction rate)
    t0    =  0.0 , (initial time, in seconds s)
    a0    =  10.0 , (initial amount of species a in Mol/L)
    b0    =  12.0 , (initial amount of species b in Mol/L)
    c0    =  3.0 , (initial amount of species c in Mol/L)
    tstop =  20.0 , (final time, in seconds s)

reaction_solve_ivp():
  Use solve_ivp() to solve the reaction ODE.

R8MAT_WRITE_TEST:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Test R8MAT_WRITE, which writes an R8MAT to a file.

  Created file "r8mat_write_test.txt".

circle_arc_grid_display_test():
  Python version: 3.6.9
  circle_arc_grid_display() displays a grid of points along a circular arc.

circle_arc_grid_display_test():
  Normal end of execution.

circle_arc_grid_points_test():
  Python version: 3.6.9
  circle_arc_grid_points() returns points along a circular arc.
  In this example, we compute points on a 90 degree arc.

  Radius =           2
  Center =           5  5

  Angle 1 =          0
  Angle 2 =          90
  Number of points = 20

  Some points on the arc:

      <b>subset</b>,
      a Python code which
      enumerates, generates, randomizes, ranks and unranks combinatorial objects
      including combinations, compositions, Gray codes, index sets, partitions, 
      permutations, polynomials, subsets, and Young tables.  Backtracking 
      routines are included to solve some combinatorial problems.  Other
      routines handle continued fractions, Diophantine equations, and
      Pythagorean triples.

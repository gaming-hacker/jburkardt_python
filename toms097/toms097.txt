i4mat_shortest_path_test
  Python version: 3.6.9
  i4mat_shortest_path uses Floyd's algorithm to find the
  shortest distance between all pairs of nodes
  in a directed graph, starting from the initial array
  of direct node-to-node distances.

  In the initial direct distance array, if
    A(I,J) = Inf,
  this indicates there is NO directed link from
  node I to node J.  In that case, the value of
  of A(I,J) is essentially "infinity".

  Initial direct-link distances:

  Col:       0        1        2        3        4  
  Row
    0:       0        2        5       -1       -1  
    1:      -1        0        7        1       -1  
    2:      -1       -1        0        4       -1  
    3:      -1       -1       -1        0        3  
    4:      -1       -1        2       -1        0

    3:      -1  
    4:       3  
    5:       0  

  In the final shortest distance array, if
    A(I,J) = -1,
  this indicates there is NO directed path from
  node I to node J.

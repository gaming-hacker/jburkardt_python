def local_min ( a, b, epsi, t, f ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## local_min() seeks a local minimum of a function F(X) in an interval [A,B].
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The method used is a combination of golden section search and
#    successive parabolic interpolation.  Convergence is never much slower
#    than that for a Fibonacci search.  If F has a continuous second
#    derivative which is positive at the minimum (which is not at A or
#    B), then convergence is superlinear, and usually of the order of
#    about 1.324....
#
#    The values EPSI and T define a tolerance TOL = EPSI * abs ( X ) + T.
#    F is never evaluated at two points closer than TOL.
#
#    If F is a unimodal function and the computed values of F are always
#    unimodal when separated by at least SQEPS * abs ( X ) + (T/3), then
#    LOCAL_MIN approximates the abscissa of the global minimum of F on the
#    interval [A,B] with an error less than 3*SQEPS*abs(LOCAL_MIN)+T.
#
#    If F is not unimodal, then LOCAL_MIN may approximate a local, but
#    perhaps non-global, minimum to the same accuracy.
#
#    Thanks to Jonathan Eggleston for pointing out a correction to the 
#    golden section step, 01 July 2013.

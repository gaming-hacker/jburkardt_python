    <p>
      <b>boundary_word_square</b>,
      a Python code which
      describes the outline of an object on a grid of squares,
      using a string of symbols that represent the sequence of steps
      tracing out the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The symbols might be 'u', 'd', 'r', and 'l', indicating that the boundary is
      to be drawn by a succession of movements of unit length, that are up, down, 
      right or left.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In some boundary word schemes, 8 symbols are required, to allow for movement
      in the N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, and SW directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In image processing, boundary words are known as "chain codes".

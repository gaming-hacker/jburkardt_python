    <p>
      <b>three_body_ode</b>,
      a Python code which
      defines a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) which
      simulates the behavior of three planets, constrained to lie in a plane,
      and moving under the influence of gravity,
      by Walter Gander and Jiri Hrebicek.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three bodies, regarded as point masses, are constrained to lie in a plane.
      The masses of each body are given, as are the positions and velocities
      at a starting time T = 0.  The bodies move in accordance with the gravitational
      force between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The force exerted on the 0-th body by the 1st body can be written:
      <pre>
        F = - m0 m1 ( p0 - p1 ) / |p0 - p1|^3
      </pre>
      assuming that units have been normalized to that the gravitational
      coefficient is 1.  Newton's laws of motion can be written:
      <pre>  
        m0 p0'' = - m0 m1 ( p0 - p1 ) / |p0 - p1|^3 
                  - m0 m2 ( p0 - p2 ) / |p0 - p2|^3
  
        m1 p1'' = - m1 m0 ( p1 - p0 ) / |p1 - p0|^3 
                  - m1 m2 ( p1 - p2 ) / |p1 - p2|^3
  
        m2 p2'' = - m2 m0 ( p2 - p0 ) / |p2 - p0|^3 
                  - m2 m1 ( p2 - p1 ) / |p2 - p1|^3
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting
      <pre>
        y1 = p0(x)
        y2 = p0(y)
        y3 = p0'(x)
        y4 = p0'(y)
      </pre>
      and using similar definitions for p1 and p2, the 3 second order vector 
      equations can be rewritten as 12 first order equations.  In particular,
      the first four are:
      <pre>
        y1' = y3
        y2' = y4
        y3' = - m1 ( y1 - y5  ) / |(y1,y2) - (y5,y6) |^3 
              - m2 ( y1 - y9  ) / |(y1,y2) - (y9,y10)|^3
        y4' = - m1 ( y2 - y6  ) / |(y1,y2) - (y5,y6) |^3 
              - m2 ( y2 - y10 ) / |(y1,y2) - (y9,y10)|^3
      </pre>
      and so on.
      This first order system can be integrated by a standard ODE solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that when any two bodies come close together, the solution changes
      very rapidly, and very small steps must be taken by the ODE solver.
      For this system, the first near collision occurs around T=15.8299, and
      the results will not be very accurate after
      that point.

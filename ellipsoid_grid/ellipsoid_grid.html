    <p>
      <b>ellipsoid_grid</b>,
      a Python code which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of an ellipsoid in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code allows the user to define an ellipsoid by
      choosing the 3D coordinates of its center and the lengths of its three axes.  
      The user also choose N, the number of subintervals into which the 
      shortest radius will be subdivided.  It then returns the gridpoints 
      defined by that choice.

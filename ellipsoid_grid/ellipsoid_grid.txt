ellipsoid_grid_count_test:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ellipsoid_grid_count can count the points in a grid,
  with N+1 points on the most minor half axis,
  based on any ellipsoid.

  We use N = 4
  Radius R = (2,1,1.5)
  Center C = (1,2,1.5)

  Number of grid points will be 1163

  Normal end of execution.

ellipsoid_grid_points_test:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ellipsoid_grid_points can define a grid of points
  with N+1 points on the minor half axis,
  based on any ellipsoid.

  We use N = 4
  Radius R = (2,1,1.5)
  Center C = (1,2,1.5)

  Number of grid points will be 1163

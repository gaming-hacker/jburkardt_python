      <b>wathen</b>,
      a Python code which
      compares storage schemes (full, banded, sparse triplet, sparse) and 
      solution strategies (A\x, Linpack, conjugate gradient (CG)) 
      for linear systems involving the Wathen matrix, 
      which can arise when solving a problem using the 
      finite element method (FEM).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Wathen matrix is a typical example of a matrix that arises during
      finite element computations.  The parameters NX and NY specify how many
      elements are to be set up in the X and Y directions.  The number of
      variables N is then
      <pre>
        N = 3 NX NY + 2 NX + 2 NY + 1
      </pre>
      and the full linear system will require N * N storage for the matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the matrix is sparse, and a banded or sparse storage scheme
      can be used to save storage.  However, even if storage is saved, a
      revised program may eat up too much time because MATLAB's sparse storage
      scheme is not efficiently used by inserting nonzero elements one at a time.
      Moreover, if banded storage is employed, the user must provide a
      suitable fast solver.  Simply "translating" a banded solver from another
      language will probably not provide an efficient routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code looks at how the complexity of the problem grows with
      increasing NX and NY; how the computing time increases; how the
      various full, banded and sparse approaches perform.

      <b>movie_test</b>,
      a Python code which
      creates a movie file from a sequence of solutions to a
      partial differential equation, using matplotlib.
    </p>

    <p>
      matplotlib provides a procedure <b>FuncAnimation()</b> for creating
      animations.  However, this procedure has limited documentation, and
      a peculiarly constrained user interface.  The user provides a ``frame(i)''
      function whose only input is the frame counter i, which must return,
      in a somewhat obscure fashion, the raw plot elements involved in the frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's not too hard to use this facility to create an animation of
      a sine curve, it's more difficult to see how to, for instance, compute
      a sequence of solutions to a partial differential equation, and display
      the sequence of time solutions in a movie file.  One difficulty is that
      this calculation requires the frame function to have access to the
      data at the previous time step, which can't be done through the parameter
      list, and which isn't easily done simply by declaring the data in the
      user's main program.  This code demonstrates one way of computing a
      scientifically interesting result and creating a movie from it.

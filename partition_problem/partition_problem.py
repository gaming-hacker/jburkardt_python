## partition_count() counts the solutions to a partition problem.

#
#    We are given a set of N integers W.

#    have equal sums.
#
#    The "discrepancy" is the absolute value of the difference between the
#    two sums, and will be zero if we have solved the problem.
#
#    For a given set of integers, there may be zero, one, or many solutions.
#
#    In the case where the weights are distinct, the count returned by this
#    function may be regarded as twice as big as it should be, since the
#    partition (W0,W1) is counted a second time as (W1,W0).  A more serious
#    overcount can occur if the set W contains duplicate elements - in the
#    extreme case, W might be entirely 1's, in which case there is really
#    only one (interesting) solution, but this function will count many.

two_body_ode_test:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Test two_body_ode().

initial_orbit:
  This simulation follows a small body for two orbits
  around a relatively massive body - such as Mercury around
  the sun.
  Keplers equations for a two body system are used.
  Note that the orbit is NOT an ellipse.  But thats OK,
  because the planet is far from its equilibrium orbit.

  Normal end of execution.

orbital_decay
  This simulation follows a small body for 20 orbits
  around a relatively massive body - such as Mercury around
  the sun.
  Keplers equations for a two body system are used.
  Initially, the orbit is NOT an ellipse, but as time passes,
  the orbit decays into an elliptical shape.

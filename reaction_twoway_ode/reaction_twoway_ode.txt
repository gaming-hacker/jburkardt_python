reaction_twoway_ode_test():
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Solve the two-way reaction ODE.

  Reaction differential equation:
    dW1/dt = - k1 W1 + k2 W2
    dW2/dt = + k1 W1 - k2 W2

  Parameter values:
    k1    =  1.0 , (reaction rate)
    k2    =  10.0 , (reaction rate)
    t0    =  0.0 , (initial time, in seconds s)
    w10   =  0.1 , (initial amount of species W1)
    w20   =  0.9 , (initial amount of species W2)
    tstop =  1.0 , (final time, in seconds s)

      <b>cube_grid</b>,
      a Python code which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a cube (actually, a hexahedron) in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
       The grid is created inside a 3D shape which we may informally
       call a cube.  Actually, it is a hexahedron (six-sided shape)
       determined by 8 user-specified vertices, given in a particular
       order that is suggested by the following list:
       <pre>
         000
         X00
         0Y0
         XY0
         00Z
         X0Z
         0YZ
         XYZ
       </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For each dimension of the three spatial dimensions, the user
      may specify the number of subintervals into which the edges of
      the hexahedron are to be divided (at least 1, in each case).
      The total number of grid points may be determined by adding one
      to each of these three numbers and computing their product.
